                <p>
                    I wanted to make something for my friends while trying out a couple 
                    new art techniques. There's only two currently due to
                    of time restraints; but I hope to add them all before we graduate.
                </p>

                            Friend "A" doubles as my roommate. We have different schedules and our own study space within the living room, 
                            so sometimes we don't interact with each other for a period of time. However, her presence is always around in the apartment, whether it's when I see her guitar resting 
                            in the sunlight or trip over her slippers (a near-daily occurence).

                <p>I used Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to create and edit, and sourced the two background images from UnSplash. Shoutout to their amazing selection!</p>

                            Friend "B" has a personal philosophy -- that everything will work out alright in the end. It's pretty admirable to me given I over-think a lot; 
                            he has a calming air that makes everything slow down and seem less doom-like, much like how I assume the world appears during archery (which he does).
